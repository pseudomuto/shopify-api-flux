# You Rock!

I definitely will need some help with this! I'm happy to receive issues, ideas, perf problems, and of course pull
requests!

## Some Useful Commands

### Linting and Testing

* `npm run lint` - lint everything in the lib folder
* `npm test` - run all the tests
* `npm test resources` - run only the tests in resources
* `npm run ci` - lint and run all tests

### Releasing

Travis is configured to push a new version to NPM whenever a tag is pushed. To push a new version, run the following
command:

`npm version (patch|minor|major)`

Releasing a new version should be done on a clean master. It will do the following (any failure stops the process):

* Lint and run all tests
* Generate a new dist version and update the docs
* Bump the version in package.json
* Add all changes and make a commit
* Create a tag for the release
* Push all changes/tags and publish docs to http://pseudomuto.com/shopify-api-flux
